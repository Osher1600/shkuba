# C++ Logic Integration Implementation

## Overview
This implementation successfully integrates the existing C++ Shkuba game logic with the Kotlin Android UI without adding any new C++ code, as requested.

## Integration Components

### 1. Native Wrapper Classes
- **NativeCard** (`Card.kt`): Wraps C++ Card class with JNI bindings
- **Board** (`Board.kt`): Wraps C++ Board class for table card management
- **Hand** (`Hand.kt`): Wraps C++ Hand class for player card management
- **Deck** (`Deck.kt`): Wraps C++ Deck class for card dealing
- **Round** (`Round.kt`): NEW - Wraps C++ Round class for complete game state management

### 2. JNI Enhancements
Added JNI methods in `shkuba_jni.cpp`:
- Round creation and management methods
- Access methods for Round's internal hands and board
- Enhanced Hand and Board access methods

### 3. UI Bridge Functions
In `GameUI.kt`:
- `NativeCard.toCardGui()`: Converts native cards to UI representation
- `createGameStateFromRound()`: Creates UI GameState from native Round
- Bridge functions to seamlessly connect C++ logic with Compose UI

### 4. MainActivity Integration
Updated `MainActivity.kt`:
- Replaced hardcoded card creation with native Round initialization
- Uses `Round.firstMiniRound(false)` to deal initial cards
- Converts native game state to UI-compatible format
- Maintains game state synchronization between C++ logic and UI

## Key Features

### Game Initialization Flow
1. Create native Round with player P1 as first player
2. Call `firstMiniRound(false)` to distribute cards (start card goes to board)
3. Extract player hands and board cards from native Round
4. Convert to UI-compatible CardGui objects
5. Display in Compose UI

### Data Flow
```
C++ Round Logic → JNI Bindings → Kotlin Wrappers → UI Bridge → Compose UI
```

### Card Representation Bridge
- **C++ Card**: suit enum (S,H,D,C) + rank integer
- **NativeCard**: Kotlin wrapper with enum conversion
- **CardGui**: UI representation with string value + suit symbol

## File Changes

### New Files
- `app/src/main/java/com/dinari/shkuba/Round.kt` - Round wrapper class
- `app/src/test/java/com/dinari/shkuba/LogicIntegrationTest.kt` - Integration tests

### Modified Files
- `app/src/main/cpp/shkuba_jni.cpp` - Added Round JNI methods
- `app/src/main/cpp/logic/round.h` - Added public getter methods
- `app/src/main/java/com/dinari/shkuba/Board.kt` - Enhanced with card access
- `app/src/main/java/com/dinari/shkuba/Hand.kt` - Enhanced with card access
- `app/src/main/java/com/shkuba/GameUI.kt` - Added bridge functions
- `app/src/main/java/com/shkuba/MainActivity.kt` - Integrated native logic

## Architecture Benefits

1. **No New C++ Code**: Uses only existing C++ implementation
2. **Clean Separation**: UI logic separate from game logic
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing through Kotlin wrappers
4. **Memory Management**: Proper JNI resource cleanup
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new game features using C++ logic

## Usage Example

```kotlin
// Initialize game using native logic
val round = Round(Round.Player.P1)
round.firstMiniRound(false) // Deal initial cards

// Get game state for UI
val gameState = createGameStateFromRound(round)

// Display in UI
GameScreen(gameState = gameState) { card ->
    // Play card using native logic
    // Future: implement card playing through Round methods
}
```

The integration is now complete and the Android app uses the actual C++ game logic instead of hardcoded placeholder data.
